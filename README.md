Abstract:
This project investigates the application of greedy algorithms, specifically Kruskal's algorithm, in designing efficient communication networks. 
A C++ program is developed to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given network graph, representing the most cost-effective way to connect 
all nodes. The report details the data structures employed, such as the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for cycle detection, and analyzes the time 
complexity and overall efficiency of the chosen algorithm.
